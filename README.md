# AI-Nanodegree
The AI-focused projects I've built during Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree course:

Foundations of AI - Term 1 Projects:

1. [X] Build a [Sudoku-solving AI](https://github.com/DMeechan/AI-Nanodegree/tree/master/Sudoku-Solver)
2. [X] Build a [Game-Playing AI](https://github.com/DMeechan/AI-Nanodegree/tree/master/Game-Playing-AI) Agent for the game Isolation
3. [X] Implement a [Planning Search](https://github.com/DMeechan/AI-Nanodegree/tree/master/Planning-Search) for moving cargo between airports
4. [X] Build a [Sign Language Recognizer](https://github.com/DMeechan/AI-Nanodegree/tree/master/Sign-Language-Recogniser)

Deep Learning & Applications - Term 2 Projects:

1. [X] [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/DMeechan/AI-Nanodegree/tree/master/projects/Dog-Breed-AI) - Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify a dog's breed from a photo
2. [X] [Time Series Prediction and Text Generation](https://github.com/DMeechan/AI-Nanodegree/tree/master/projects/Recurrent-Neural-Network) - Create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict future values in a time series and generate text
3. [X] [Speech recognition](https://github.com/DMeechan/AI-Nanodegree/tree/master/projects/DNN-Speech-Recogniser) - Build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to perform automatic speech recognition
